## Ask

1. Find the best ROI movie.
2. See if certain cast generate more revenue.
3. How genre popularity change from year.


## Prepare

The dataset is downloaded from Coursea's Google Data Analytics Course.

## Process
### Step 1. Check duplicates

1. See the title row to see which columns are not suppose to have duplicates. 
```sql
SELECT
 *
FROM
`ferrous-destiny-344108.movie_dataset.movie_data`
```
2. Movie title are less likely to have duplicates, so we need to check if using DISTINCT can return the same rows.
```sql
SELECT
 DISTINCT Movie_Title
FROM
`ferrous-destiny-344108.movie_dataset.movie_data`
```
3. Check other columns that are less likely to have duplicates. 
```sql
SELECT
 DISTINCT Wikipedia_URL
FROM
`ferrous-destiny-344108.movie_dataset.movie_data`
```

(Since the strings in this dataset does not have the same length, therefore, here we will not be using LENGTH, TRIM. We do not need to convert any data to other data type, so we will not be using CAST, CONCAT)

### Step 2. Find null 

```sql
SELECT
 COALESCE(Director__1_)
FROM
`ferrous-destiny-344108.movie_dataset.movie_data`
```
